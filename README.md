# JavaScript Exercises

This repository is used to store the Javascript code found in the book [What you need to know about Javascript](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AotpOipZ2Sr2hhsT-3OSA2uuounE), written by [me](https://ar.linkedin.com/in/gacanepa), reviewed by [Walter Molina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waltermolina/), and published by Packt Publishing.

> The book was originally written around the time ES6 was released. Although it was not revised following more recent specifications, I have tried to keep the code in this repository as up to date as possible. Thus, you will find more examples and notes corresponding to [ES7+](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_new-javascript-features.html) inside of each folder. If you would like to contribute, feel free to submit a PR.
